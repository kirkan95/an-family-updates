She started the year running around as a production assistant on a few music videos, and began following in her sister’s footsteps into photography. She began working at a preschool for the 2025-2026 school year and has been spending her days with 3 year olds since. In her free time, she is still dancing, of course, doing small projects with her friends and taking classes for fun. One of her favorite things to do is to meet up with her college friends to journal or read together at cafes."
