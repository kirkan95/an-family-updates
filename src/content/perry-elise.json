Perry is still working as a consultant for Lockheed Martin and serves at church as an Audio Visual Tech as well as preaching on occasion.  Turning 65 has meant the availability of a number of discounts and enrollment in Medicare, but Perry has not availed himself of the all important Early Bird Specials at Denny's, mostly because there aren't any around South Jersey anymore.  Elise is an active volunteer at the New Jersey PTA serving as Health and Safety Chair. She has also continued to substitute teach occasionally at the Cherry Hill School District.   In addition to the NJPTA, Elise has spent time taking care of her mother in San Diego, Arie our beautiful new granddaughter, born to Laura and Arnold this September, and her plants, some spawned from her Aero Garden.  She is especially proud of her cherry tomatoes. We have managed to continue meeting with our beloved South Jersey Bible Study group over the magic that is ZOOM, as well as our family tradition of Sunday evening family time across state lines, again over ZOOM.

Elise and Perry had a bucket list trip to upstate New York to see the solar eclipse but was hampered by thick dark clouds.  In May, we had a wonderful, relaxing family vacation (all of the children and their spouses) due to the graciousness and generosity of Lowell and Judy Soong who allowed us to stay in their beautiful home in Oahu. We also traveled to Atlanta, as part of Perry's MLB Ballpark tour, to enjoy Southern cuisine and fellowship with Pai and Kim Chung, and to catch a Braves game at Truist Stadium.  Finally we had an early Thanksgiving celebration near Fairfax for the entire family to officially meet Arie.","img_name":null,"special_values_name":null,"sv_primary_color":null,"sv_secondary_color":null,"sv_tertiary_color":null,"sv_display_name":null},{"section_type":"subhed","text":"Best meals","img_name":null,"special_values_name":null,"sv_primary_color":null,"sv_secondary_color":null,"sv_tertiary_color":null,"sv_display_name":null},{"section_type":"image-list","text":null,"img_name":"mille-fuille","special_values_name":null,"sv_primary_color":null,"sv_secondary_color":null,"sv_tertiary_color":null,"sv_display_name":null},{"section_type":"paragraph","text":"<b>Mille fuille: <\/b> We tried our hand at making this viral hotpot trend; pork slices tucked between cabbage with an enoki bouquet at its heart, bathed in a chicken-sha cha broth.
